/**
 * What the panels actually draw.
 *
 * A panel's whole contract is "run the calc, return these layers", and until
 * `buildRun()` went public nothing could check the second half — a panel could
 * stop emitting its outline entirely and the suite would stay green. These
 * instantiate the classes directly: the panels inject nothing, so they need no
 * TestBed, and `recordLayers` stands in for the canvas.
 *
 * The bar is deliberately low per panel — that it draws, that it draws real
 * finite geometry, and that the view flags it advertises actually gate what
 * comes out. Pinning exact primitive counts would break on every cosmetic
 * change and tell nobody anything.
